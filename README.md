## Installation enviroment
## Set up the virtual environemt (Interpreter)
I've simply installed virtual environment in my local project folder using below command

```shell
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

> Then, you can see `.venv` folder on your project folder, but `.gitignore` won't store that folder in your repository.
